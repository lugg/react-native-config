# Config variables for React Native apps

Module to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native, supporting both iOS and Android.

Bring some [12 factor](http://12factor.net/config) love to your mobile apps!


## Usage

Create a new file `.env` in the root of your React Native app:

```
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

Then access variables defined there from your app:

```js
import Config from 'react-native-config'

Config.API_URL  // 'https://myapi.com'
Config.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  // 'abcdefgh'
```

Keep in mind this module doesn't obfuscate or encrypt secrets for packaging, so **do not store sensitive keys in `.env`**. It's [basically impossible to prevent users from reverse engineering mobile app secrets](https://rammic.github.io/2015/07/28/hiding-secrets-in-android-apps/), so design your app (and APIs) with that in mind.


### Android

Config variables set in `.env` are available to your Java classes via `BuildConfig`:

```java
public HttpURLConnection getApiClient() {
    URL url = new URL(BuildConfig.API_URL);
    // ...
}
```

You can also read them from your Gradle configuration:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    applicationId project.env.get("APP_ID")
}
```

And use them to configure libraries in `AndroidManifest.xml` and others:

```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
  android:value="@string/GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" />
```

All variables are strings, so you may need to cast them. For instance, in Gradle:

```
versionCode project.env.get("VERSION_CODE").toInteger()
```

Once again, remember variables stored in `.env` are published with your code, so **DO NOT put anything sensitive there like your app `signingConfigs`.**

### iOS

Read variables declared in `.env` from your Obj-C classes like:

```objective-c
// import header
#import "ReactNativeConfig.h"

// then read individual keys like:
NSString *apiUrl = [ReactNativeConfig envFor:@"API_URL"];

// or just fetch the whole config
NSDictionary *config = [ReactNativeConfig env];
```

They're also available for configuration in `Info.plist`, by prepending `__RN_CONFIG_` to their name:

```
__RN_CONFIG_API_URL
```

Note: Requires specific setup (see below) and a `Product > Clean` is required after changing the values to see the updated values.


### Different environments

Save config for different environments in different files: `.env.staging`, `.env.production`, etc.

By default react-native-config will read from `.env`, but you can change it when building or releasing your app.

The simplest approach is to tell it what file to read with an environment variable, like:

```
$ ENVFILE=.env.staging react-native run-ios           # bash
$ SET ENVFILE='.env.staging' && react-native run-ios  # windows
$ env:ENVFILE=".env.staging"; react-native run-ios    # powershell
```
or

```
react-native run-ios --scheme="Staging"   
```

This also works for `run-android`. Alternatively, there are platform-specific options below.


#### Android

The same environment variable can be used to assemble releases with a different config:

```
$ cd android && ENVFILE=.env.staging ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Alternatively, you can define a map in `build.gradle` associating builds with env files. Do it before the `apply from` call, and use build cases in lowercase, like:

```
project.ext.envConfigFiles = [
    debug: ".env.development",
    release: ".env.production",
    anothercustombuild: ".env",
]

apply from: project(':react-native-config').projectDir.getPath() + "/dotenv.gradle"
```


#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

Start by creating a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "Myapp (staging)"

Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

- Expand the "Build" settings on left
- Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
- Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type:
  ```
  echo ".env.staging" > /tmp/envfile   # replace .env.staging for your file
  ```

This is still a bit experimental and dirty – let us know if you have a better idea on how to make iOS use different configurations opening a pull request or issue!


## Setup

Install the package:

```
$ yarn add react-native-config
```

Link the library:

```
$ react-native link react-native-config
```


### Extra step for Android

You'll also need to manually apply a plugin to your app, from `android/app/build.gradle`:

```
// 2nd line, add a new apply:
apply from: project(':react-native-config').projectDir.getPath() + "/dotenv.gradle"
```


### Extra step for iOS to support Info.plist

* Go to your project -> Build Settings -> All
* Search for "preprocess"
* Set `Preprocess Info.plist File` to `Yes`
* Set `Info.plist Preprocessor Prefix File` to `${BUILD_DIR}/GeneratedInfoPlistDotEnv.h`
* Set `Info.plist Other Preprocessor Flags` to `-traditional`
* If you don't see those settings, verify that "All" is selected at the top (instead of "Basic")


#### Advanced Android Setup

In `android/app/build.gradle`, if you use `applicationIdSuffix` or `applicationId` that is different from the package name indicated in `AndroidManifest.xml` in `<manifest package="...">` tag, for example, to support different build variants:
Add this in `android/app/build.gradle`

```
defaultConfig {
    ...
    resValue "string", "build_config_package", "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME_IN_ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with Proguard

When Proguard is enabled (which it is by default for Android release builds), it can rename the `BuildConfig` Java class in the minification process and prevent React Native Config from referencing it. To avoid this, add an exception to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

    -keep class com.mypackage.BuildConfig { *; }
    
`mypackage` should match the `package` value in your `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.

## Testing

### Jest

For mocking the `Config.FOO_BAR` usage, create a mock at `__mocks__/react-native-config.js`:

```
// __mocks__/react-native-config.js
export default {
  FOO_BAR: 'baz',
};
```
